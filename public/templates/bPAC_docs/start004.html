<b>Printer driver of target printer </b> <br>
 To set up a target printer, run the driver installer from the P-touch Editor CD-ROM, or download the correct driver from the Brother support website (<b><a href="https://support.brother.com/">https://support.brother.com/</a></b>).<br>
 If you have already installed the printer driver, you do not need to install it again.</font><p>
</li>
<li>
<font face="Arial" size="3">
<b>Template files </b>&nbsp;<br>
 Since b-PAC refers to the templates, the templates created using P-touch Editor 
are needed. <br>
The templates can even be stored on a file sharing server.<br>
 In addition, if the target driver is installed and the template files are 
available, P-touch Editor is not needed to run b-PAC.<br>
For details, refer to <b><a href="template001.html">&quot;What are template files?&quot;</a></b>.</font></li>
